* Total Patients: A summary of the total patient count.
* Gender Analysis: Percentage of male and female patients.
* Age Distribution: Comparison of patients over and under 50 years old.
* Admission Types by Age Group: Distribution of elective, urgent, and emergency admissions based on age groups.
* Blood Type Distribution: Proportion of each blood type within the patient population.
* Medical Conditions by Gender: Analysis of common medical conditions segmented by gender.

### Analytical Questions
To further explore the dataset, consider these questions:

##### Gender Analysis:
###### How does gender distribution correlate with specific medical conditions or admission types?

##### Age Distribution:
###### Are patients over 50 more likely to have specific medical conditions that result in urgent or emergency admissions?

##### Admission Types by Age Group:
###### What factors drive the need for urgent or emergency admissions in patients below 50 vs. those over 50?

##### Blood Type Distribution:
###### Could certain blood types be linked with higher risks of specific medical conditions or influence the type of care required?

##### Medical Conditions by Gender:
###### What additional insights could we gain by analyzing these conditions by both age and gender?
